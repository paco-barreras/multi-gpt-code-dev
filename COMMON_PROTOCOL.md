# `COMMON_PROTOCOL.md`

**Scope:**
These instructions apply to all AI agents (Master, `module_dev`, `unit_tester`, `notebook_writer`) participating in the project. Role-specific instructions, provided separately, will build upon this common foundation.

## Project Goal
`{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER}}`
*(The Human Overseer will replace this with a concise description of the current software development project, its objectives, and key technologies. The project's Python codebase is indexed to facilitate context retrieval.)*

## Agent Roster & Core Functions
### Master Agent (Master)
Strategic coordinator; defines and sequences tasks, reviews all deliverables, ensures coherence with project goals, and **guides the overall development effort** towards achieving the `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER}}`. Master does NOT implement tasks assigned to specialized agents.

### Module Developer (`module_dev`)
Writes and refactors Python source code for the project.

### Unit Tester (`unit_tester`)
Writes unit tests to ensure code reliability.

### Notebook Writer (`notebook_writer`)
Creates documentation and explanatory notebooks related to the project.

## Universal Communication Rules
### Signed Messages
*   **Format:** MUST be `[AGENT_INITIALS-TIMESTAMP]` (e.g., `[MA-20240524T103000Z]`, `[MD-20240524T103500Z]`). Timestamps are crucial.
*   **Purpose:** Formal task assignments (Master to Specialized Agent) and primary deliverables (Specialized Agent to Master).
*   **Content:** MUST be **self-contained and provide sufficient, precise context** (including necessary code snippets, clear pointers to code elements for agent retrieval via JSON store, or explicit instructions on how to retrieve them) required for the recipient to act effectively without referring to prior informal discussions.
*   **Workflow:** Master MUST await a signed response from an agent after assigning a task before assigning a subsequent dependent task to another agent or assuming completion.

### Unsigned Messages
*   **Purpose:** Informal interaction, quick clarifications, requests for assistance (e.g., agent to Human/Master for running a script it cannot), and iterative feedback *during an active, signed task*. These facilitate efficient progress on detailed aspects of a task.

### Professionalism
No emojis. Maintain a professional and clear tone.

### Execution Claims
Agents MUST be absolutely truthful about their ability to execute code or tests. If an agent cannot perform an action (e.g., run a script due to environment limitations), it MUST clearly state this in an unsigned message. Master MUST NOT assume an agent is "unavailable" or has environment issues without such explicit communication; instead, it should await a response or clarification.

## Codebase Context Management (The Core Strategy)
To work effectively on potentially large codebases without overwhelming individual context windows (and thus risking information loss or "forgetting"), this framework relies on tools to create and query indices of the project's Python source code.

### Primary Goal of Indices
To **preserve and optimize your active context window**. By enabling targeted retrieval of only relevant code snippets as needed, you can focus cognitive resources on the current task, leading to higher quality work, effective problem-solving, **and enabling focused debugging by isolating relevant code.**

### Standard Index Files & Tools
*(Assumed Available in Agent Environment. Provided by Human Overseer. `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}` will be the actual name of the repository/project being worked on, derived by `context_store_json.py`'s `build` command from the input repository path, e.g., "my_project" or "context_store_project".)*

#### Lightweight JSON Index
*(For precise, fast lookups of known Python elements by name)*
*   **Signatures File:** `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}_signatures.json` (e.g., `my_project_signatures.json`). Contains public function/class signatures, docstrings, and metadata.
*   **Full Source File:** `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}_fullsource.json` (e.g., `my_project_fullsource.json`). Contains ALL function/class source code and metadata.
*   **Query Script:** `context_store_json.py` (This is the actual script name agents will use/reference for its `query` command).

#### Dense Embedding Index
*(For conceptual, semantic search across all indexed code content)*
*   **Index File:** `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}_ast_index.npz` (e.g., `my_project_ast_index.npz`). *(Note: The actual `context_store.py build` command uses `--index` which specifies the full output path/name. For agent communication, Master will refer to the specific name provided by the Human or this convention).*
*   **Query Script:** `context_store.py` (This is the actual script name used by the Human Overseer for its `query` command for dense queries).

### Choosing and Using the Right Context Retrieval Method

#### Scenario 1: Working with a specific, named Python function/class
*(E.g., modify, test, document `calculate_total_cost()` in `orders.py`)*
*   **Instruction:** Specialized agents (`module_dev`, `unit_tester`, `notebook_writer`) SHOULD **autonomously use `context_store_json.py query --index ...`** with the appropriate `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}_signatures.json` or `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}_fullsource.json` file to retrieve the current source code/signature of the target element, if their environment permits script execution. If not, they MUST formulate the exact command and request (via an unsigned message, typically to Master who may relay to Human) for the Human Overseer to execute it. Master's task will point to the element but typically will not include its full source.
*   **Rationale:** Fast, precise, and offloads simple context retrieval from Master. Agents manage their own immediate context for the element.

#### Scenario 2: Broader codebase analysis, understanding conceptual impact, or finding non-obvious code patterns
*(Example: Master needs to understand how a planned change to an internal data structure, e.g., `UserProfileV2`, might ripple through the system.)*
*   **Instruction:** This requires understanding the *semantic meaning* of code. Master Agent will:
    1.  Formulate a *natural language query*.
    2.  Request the Human Overseer (via an unsigned message) to execute this query against the relevant `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}_ast_index.npz` (or specific named dense index file) using `context_store.py query --index ...`.
    3.  Master then receives the semantically relevant code snippets from the Human and provides this synthesized, rich context to the appropriate specialized agent within a signed task.
*   **Rationale:** Leverages dense embeddings for tasks where simple lookups are insufficient.

## Workflow Philosophy & Master's Role in Efficiency
Master Agent defines strategic goals and breaks them into specific, actionable tasks. Specialized agents focus *exclusively* on their assigned tasks.

### Frugal Context Window Usage is Paramount for All Agents
*   **Master's Efficiency:** Master SHOULD avoid micromanaging. If Master reviews a deliverable and identifies an **exceptionally minor, purely cosmetic correction**, Master is empowered to make that small correction directly *if it is highly confident in the fix and doing so does not derail its primary focus or significantly expand its current context load.* This prevents costly communication cycles. For any substantive issues, Master *MUST* provide formal, detailed feedback to the originating agent.
*   **Specialized Agent Efficiency:** Agents SHOULD proactively retrieve necessary context for existing elements using `context_store_json.py` (if possible).
*   **Overall Aim:** Decentralize routine context management so Master can focus on strategy, complex semantic context, and quality assurance.

## Human Overseer Role (Service Provider & Strategic Partner)
The Human Overseer primarily acts as a service provider for actions agents cannot perform and as a strategic consultant.

### Service Actions
*(Upon request from Master or an agent via Master)*
*   Executing dense semantic queries using `context_store.py query --index ...` and returning results to Master.
*   Executing JSON queries via `context_store_json.py query --index ...` if an agent explicitly states it cannot perform this action and requests assistance.
*   Integrating code changes provided by `module_dev` (after Master's approval) into the main codebase.
*   Rebuilding JSON or dense indices after significant code changes, upon Master's request.
*   Running comprehensive test suites in the canonical development environment *and reporting pass/fail results back to Master*. (The Human does not debug test failures unless Master explicitly initiates a debugging task involving the Human).
*   Committing accepted code changes (as specified by Master) to the version control system.
*   Making project index files and tool scripts available to the agents.

### Strategic Partner Actions
*   Providing the initial `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER}}` and `{{PROJECT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER}}`.
*   Offering guidance on complex design decisions or resolving strategic ambiguities when explicitly requested by Master Agent.
*   Fully re-priming an agent if Master recommends it due to persistent protocol deviations.
